  - Base manifests with portcullis cluster overlays
  - Documentation: `docs/confluent-platform.md` with usage guide
- **cert-manager** (sync-wave 20)
  - Helm-based deployment using OCI chart from Quay (v1.19.2)
  - Multi-source pattern with Git-based values files
  - Base configuration enables CRDs only for minimal footprint
  - Cluster overlay for portcullis-specific settings
  - Essential for TLS certificate management across infrastructure
- **cert-manager-resources** (sync-wave 75)
  - Kustomize-based deployment of certificate management resources
  - Self-signed ClusterIssuer for internal certificate generation
  - Deployed after cert-manager to ensure CRDs are available
  - Provides foundation for internal PKI
- **argocd-ingress** (sync-wave 80)
  - Kustomize-based Traefik IngressRoute for ArgoCD UI access
  - Certificate resource for TLS (argocd.portcullis.osow.ski)
  - ServersTransport for internal HTTPS communication with ArgoCD
  - Base manifests use placeholder patterns (CLUSTER_NAME.DOMAIN)
  - Cluster overlays patch with specific hostnames
  - Enables secure external access to ArgoCD without port-forwarding
- **kube-prometheus-stack-crds** (sync-wave 2)
  - Standalone Helm deployment for Prometheus Operator CRDs
  - Deployed very early (wave 2) to ensure CRDs available before other components
  - Decoupled from main kube-prometheus-stack deployment (wave 20)
  - Helm values configured to enable only CRDs, disabling all other components
  - Addresses CRD timing issues with ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule resources
- Comprehensive Helm deployment guide (`docs/adding-helm-workloads.md`)

- **kube-prometheus-stack monitoring** (sync-wave 20)
  - Complete monitoring stack with Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
  - Base values with conservative resource limits
  - Portcullis cluster overlay with ingress configuration
  - ServiceMonitor and PrometheusRule CRDs enabled (via separate kps-crds app)
  - Persistent storage for Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager
- **Sync wave annotations** for deployment ordering
  - Bootstrap: wave 0
  - Parent applications: waves 1, 100
  - Infrastructure: waves 10-50
  - Workloads: waves 105+
- **Kustomization files** in cluster directories
  - `clusters/<cluster>/infrastructure/kustomization.yaml` lists infrastructure apps
  - `clusters/<cluster>/workloads/kustomization.yaml` lists workload apps
  - Parent Applications monitor these files for discovery

### Changed
- **ArgoCD self-management deferred to future state**
  - ArgoCD remains as manual installation for now (not self-managed via GitOps)
  - Self-management documentation consolidated for future reference
  - Decision allows focus on infrastructure components first
  - ArgoCD access now provided via argocd-ingress Application (Traefik IngressRoute)
  - See `docs/argocd-self-management.md` for future migration guidance
- **BREAKING: Bootstrap pattern restructured**
  - Moved from `bootstrap/values-<cluster>.yaml` to `clusters/<cluster>/bootstrap.yaml`
  - Bootstrap now uses inline `valuesObject` for cluster configuration
  - Bootstrap deployed as ArgoCD Application with sync-wave 0
  - Enables per-cluster GitOps management of bootstrap configuration
- **Multi-source Application pattern for Helm charts**
  - Infrastructure applications use `sources` (plural) instead of single `source`
  - First source: upstream Helm chart (OCI or HTTP repository)
  - Second source: values files from Git repository using `ref: values`
  - Values referenced with `$values/infrastructure/<component>/...` pattern
  - Replaced raw GitHub URL pattern with multi-source approach
- **Parent Application naming**
  - Changed from `infrastructure-apps` and `workloads-apps` to `infrastructure` and `workloads`
  - Simplified naming convention for clarity
- **Infrastructure component deployment**
  - Moved from future/placeholder to implemented for traefik and kube-prometheus-stack
  - Added `ServerSideApply=true` sync option for CRDs
  - Added retry policies with exponential backoff
- Updated documentation:
  - `docs/architecture.md` - Bootstrap pattern, multi-source applications, sync waves, current state
  - `docs/adding-applications.md` - Multi-source Helm pattern, sync waves, kustomization updates
  - `docs/bootstrap-procedure.md` - New bootstrap Application deployment procedure
  - `docs/cluster-onboarding.md` - Updated for new bootstrap pattern and kustomization files
  - `README.md` - Reference to new Helm deployment guide
